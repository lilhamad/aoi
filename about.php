   The school At-tibyan online Islamic (Aoislamic) is the brain child of Toyyib shuaib Atata, it was established in the year 2012 to serve as an online Islamic school rendering assistances, motivations and agitations to the youth of Nigeria who are with full passion to learn Arabic and Islamic studies at a starting or beginners level. It is first of its kind. The online Islamic school focuses the youth at beginners stage, what resulted into its establishment was a research or an investigation which the RECTOR Toyyib shuaib Atata carried out on how to improve and spread the "DEEN" which is the primary assignment of everyone in this world(Q51:56) and no other way to achieve this than spreading the "KNOWLEDGE". 
<br><br>
   It is through this knowledge the scholars of islam in every part of the world spread the religion likewise our scholars in Nigeria, the past and the present (jazahumu'llahu khairan) Nigeria which was before populated with kuffar, Alhamdulilah muslims are countable today through knowledge. Today the world has changed to technology world, computer age which now turned almost all things from the way it used to be, a youth prefer seclusion in a room with his/ her computer be it phones or any electronic accessories than going to school doing all sorts with it which do not please Allah subhaanahi watahaala, likewise the research still shows that some use it on goods, like listening to Quran, hadith, lectures, learning and so on, there we have some categories of the youth: 
</p>
<p>
 1-Some are willing to learn but not chance to enroll in Madrasat due to school activities and some other activities.<br>
 2-Some have enrolled but couldn't cope because it seems not very easy for them.<br>
 3-Some have issues with a particular course either Quran, tajweed, taoheed, nahw(morphology) and sarf(etymology) and so on.<br>
 4-Some do not have any knowledge on Arabic and Islamic at all but wish to know.<br>
 5-Some find it difficult to enroll in madrasa but he/she believe in personal tutoring.<br>
 And it is through having this Arabic and Islamic knowledge one will know his/her God, the Religion and so on. <br>
 These are the reasons why the RECTOR looked into and establish the online islamic school to stand to assist the categories of people aforementioned in Nigeria, since the Hadith of the prophet (S.A.W) says "Allah makes the way to jannah easy for him who tread a path in search of knowledge"(muslim).<br>
  The Program of the school take places on the school website and on mobile phones via whatsapp, the member body learn through watching and listening to video and audio lectures as well as reading pdf format text with the support of well trained tutors. Alhamdulilah today we have 100+ of muslim youth (graduate and under graduate) benefiting from the school we pray Allah makes it beneficial and accept it as an act of ibaadah, Ameen.
